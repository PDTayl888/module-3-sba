Challenges you encountered during the project.
Your approach to solving these challenges.
Improvements you would make if given more time.

1. The main challenge is the tedious trial and error of looking up the keywords in the documentation, finding them, seeing it doesn't work and trying more until they work

2. My main approach was make a skeleton with elements and borders, then placing them correctly with flexbox or grid then styling. Although in practice theses steps weren't fully separate it is what
    I tried to keep in mind.

3. If given more time I would make it pixel perfect and add more functionality, possibly with some JavaScript.
